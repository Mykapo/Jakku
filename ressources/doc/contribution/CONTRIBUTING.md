# How to contribute

In order to help [Jakku](https://github.com/Mykapo/Jakku) to prosper, or to improve it, you might want to contribute. As it is an Open Source project, you encourage you to do so, but highly recommend you to read the following lines.

## Foreword

First of all, you need to read the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

This project was started using [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to make iterations and more basically every commit more readable. **We highly encourage you to use it**. If you're not using it, in order to maintain consistency with the practices encouraged by [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), we will ask you to read and follow the operation that you can find in the [documentation](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), or in [Daniel Kummer's cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

## Open an issue

You might need to open an issue for different cases. For any case, please check that :
* What you are looking for does'nt exist in the documentation 
* A similar issue hasn't already been opened.

### Question or problem

For question or problem, your issue's title **MUST** be written "Q&P : <title of your issue>". We would love to help you as soon as we could. In order to do so, you might help us helping you. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as a very good documentation about [how to ask a question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

To summarize it, the title must be relevant, you should detail what you have tried to solve it, and if you find an answer before someone helps you find it, it will be very appreciated if you could explain what is the solution found. Working like this really helps avoiding duplicates as it can also help someone else can have the same problem.

### Bug found

If you found a bug, your issue's title **MUST** be written "BUG : <title of your issue>". In the issue itself, you should specify the version of **Jakku** you are using, your environment (anything relevant to help us reproduce the bug), and write a small paragraph that explain how to reproduce the bug. In a "best-case scenario", feel free to [submit a pull request](#Submit-a-pull-request) to correct the bug.
